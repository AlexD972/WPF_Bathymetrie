## About 📖
**WPF_Bathymetry** is a software that allows the visualization of bathymetric data from a beach. It offers an intuitive interface to explore and understand the variations in water depth.

## Programming Language 💻
This project is realized with the **C#** language using the **.NET Core 8 WPF** framework. I have adopted the **MVVM** design pattern to ensure a clean and maintainable code structure.

## How to Use the Software 🛠️
To use WPF_Bathymetry, follow these steps:

1. Enter data in the "**Data at time T**" tab. This data represents the bathymetry at the time the water depths are recorded.
2. Indicate the tide present at the time of these readings in the "**Data at 0 of the maps**" tab.

Once these steps are completed, you can:

- Make a forecast of the bathymetry of a beach knowing the future tide in the "**Tide forecast**" tab.
- Visualize the profile of a beach marker in the "**Profile of the markers**" tab.
- Visualize the beach from a top view in the "**Top view**" tab.
